## The application
The Shiny App can be found at:
https://xcidev.shinyapps.io/dataprods

## How does it work

A Linear Model fit is done over the Galton's parent-child height data:

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(UsingR)
mod <- lm(child~parent, data=galton)
child <- predict(mod, data.frame(parent=parent))
```
